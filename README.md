# Order Up

## User Story

As a restaurant business owner, I would want my restaurant to be organized and provide customers with good dining experience. With a restaurant ordering system, I will be able to track food orders, make sure we don't lose order tickets. Also I will be able to keep track of employee working shifts, inventories, and also update new dish to the menu.
